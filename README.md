# Code Structure

- Create html, css and js files
- setup blank grid (put it in a table?)
- grid lines 
- place item in clicked space

# UI
- Move reversal?
- Score
- arrow above board
- confirmation/back button?
- show user where counter will appear?
- dynamic board sizes
- could have spans with circles inside the divs - this might make them more circular!
